Agent SDK Recognition Report
=============================
Date: 2025-01-10

FILES CHECKED:
- lib/ddsa/agent-orchestrator.ts: ❌ NOT FOUND
- lib/ddsa/agents/*.ts: ❌ NOT FOUND

STATUS: ❌ Agent SDK not implemented

RECOMMENDATION:
Agent SDK not implemented — recommended next step: implement orchestrator using OpenAI Agents SDK or in-house agent runner.

The current implementation provides:
- ✅ DB adapter layer for Responses API
- ✅ API route wrapper (call-v2)
- ✅ Instruction sets and response persistence

Missing components for full agent orchestration:
- ❌ Agent orchestrator/coordinator
- ❌ Agent lifecycle management
- ❌ Multi-agent coordination
- ❌ Agent state management
- ❌ Agent-to-agent communication

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement agent-orchestrator.ts to coordinate multiple agents
2. Create agent definitions in lib/ddsa/agents/
3. Integrate with OpenAI Agents SDK when available
4. Add agent state persistence to ai_responses or new agent_state table
